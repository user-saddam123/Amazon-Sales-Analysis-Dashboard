## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to design and develop a Power BI dashboard that not only captivates visually but also efficiently presents key insights. 

The aim is to provide stakeholders with a tool that facilitates informed decision-making by offering strategic insights in a clear and understandable manner. Through this dashboard, stakeholders will be empowered to decipher complex data effortlessly, thus enabling them to make well-informed strategic decisions with ease.

## About Dataset:

The dataset provided for this project spans from April 2022 to June 2022 and comprises Amazon sales data. 

It includes essential attributes such as product name, product image URL, price, units sold, item details, city, country, state, and other pertinent information. 

This comprehensive dataset not only encompasses transactional details but also incorporates contextual data, facilitating a holistic analysis of Amazon sales during the specified period. Additionally, the inclusion of product images enhances the visual appeal and interpretability of the dataset, contributing to a more immersive analytical experience.

## Tools Used:

In line with the objectives and project requirements, I have utilized Power BI, a powerful business intelligence tool, for dashboard creation. Additionally, I have employed Excel to some extent to ensure that the data is formatted clearly and in a usable manner.

### Lets Move to our insights Section:

## Dashboard Overview:

In response to the problem statement and objective, three distinct pages have been crafted within the Power BI dashboard. 

 * The initial page delves into detailed analysis, presenting a comprehensive overview of the data. Subsequently,

 * The second page is dedicated to providing a holistic product overview, offering insights into various product attributes and performance metrics.

 * Finally, the third page is designed for a focused examination, allowing users to delve into specific product views and glean insights tailored to selected products.

This multi-page approach ensures a nuanced exploration of the dataset, catering to diverse analytical needs and enhancing decision-making capabilities for stakeholders.
